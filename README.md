# Breast Tissue Histopathology Classification

## Problem
Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of breast cancer. Accurate and early detection of breast cancer is critical for patient outcomes. Pathologists analyze histopathology images to distinguish benign from malignant tissue. This project develops a model to classify breast histopathology image patches as *benign* or *malignant* using machine learning and deep learning methods.

  - Binary classes: benign vs malignant tissue patches
  - Class distribution: 198,738 IDC negative, 78,786 IDC positive
