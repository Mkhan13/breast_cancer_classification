# Breast Tissue Histopathology Classification

## Problem
Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of breast cancer. Accurate and early detection of breast cancer is critical for patient outcomes. Pathologists analyze histopathology images to distinguish benign from malignant tissue, but only have an accuracy of around 75%. This project develops a model to classify breast histopathology image patches as *benign* or *malignant* using machine learning and deep learning methods with the goal of improving the diagnostic accuracy compared to pathologists.

## Data Source
- **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) Histology Image Dataset** on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images)  
  - Binary classes: benign vs malignant tissue patches
  - Class distribution: 198,738 IDC negative, 78,786 IDC positive

## Review of Relevant Previous Efforts and Literature  
[This study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-19278-2?fromPaywallRec=false), published in 2022, focuses on the multiclass classification of breast cancer tissue using deep learning methods using the Colsanitas dataset. [This 2021 study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8582388/#cancers-13-05368-t001) similarly focuses on using deep learning to classify breast cancer tissue as benign or malignant using a dataset they curated from a variety of hospitals.

**My Contribution:**  
While projects applying deep learning to breast cancer clasification have been conducted previously, my project provides direct comparisons against traditional machine learning models or naive baselines using a dataset that is not often used for research due to the size and complexity of the data.
